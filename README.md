# scaffoldFn

**scaffoldFn** is a schema-driven code generation tool designed to empower developers through transparency, modularity, and local-first workflows. Whether you're scaffolding new services or bootstrapping consistent infrastructure, scaffoldFn simplifies setup while encouraging ownership and adaptability.

> ⚠️ **Privacy Statement: No AI, No Server, No Transmission**  
> scaffoldFn does **not** use artificial intelligence or machine learning. All generation logic is schema-driven, deterministic, and rule-based.  
> scaffoldFn is built on a strict local-only ethos:  
> - It will never transmit, upload, or share user data or code.  
> - No server-side components are used or planned.  
> - Even in browser-based usage, **no portion of your data is ever sent externally**.  
> You own your scaffolding. Fully. Locally. Permanently.
